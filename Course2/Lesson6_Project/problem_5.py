TASK5:
Blockchain

A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list.
Each block contains some information and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain.
Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.
For our blockchain we will be using a SHA-256 hash, the Greenwich Mean Time when the block was created,
and text strings as the data.

Use your knowledge of linked lists and hashing to create a blockchain implementation.

"""
"""
NOTE:
A blockchain is essentially a linked list that contains ordered data, 
with a few constraints such as:

    Blocks canâ€™t be modified once added; in other words, it is append only.
    There are specific rules for appending data to it.
    Its architecture is distributed.
