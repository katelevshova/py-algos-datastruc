#Task1------------------------
Let's N be the number of records.
Going through all records of 1 file in the function count_unique_telephone_number() will take O(N).
We can disregard everything in line#25 because
the length of telephone number is not larger than 20 chars which is not insignificant.
The same for line#26.
We call the function count_unique_telephone_number() two times for each file which can be counted as O(2N)
however we can disregard all coefficients which leaves us with the result runtime complexity O(N).
