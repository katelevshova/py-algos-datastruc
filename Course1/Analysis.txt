#Task1------------------------
Let's N be the number of records in a file.
    Going through all records of 1 file in the function count_unique_telephone_number() will take O(N).
    We can disregard everything in line#25 and line#26 because
    the length of telephone number is not larger than 20 chars which is not insignificant.
    The rest lines in the function takes constant time O(1).
We call the function count_unique_telephone_number() two times for each file which can be counted as O(2N)
however we can disregard all coefficients which leaves us with the result runtime complexity O(N).
ANSWER: O(N)

#Task2------------------------
Let's N be the number of records in a file.
    Call of the function create_telnumbers_dict_for_period() takes O(N) times because we are going through
    all records in the file. We can disregard the time for calling the function get_date() in line#46 because it is not
    significant. Adding to the dictionary takes constant O(1) time.
Let's M be the number of elements in telnumbers_calltime_dict.
    Call of the function get_telnumber_with_max_calltime() takes O(M) where
    we go through all elements in the dictionary.
The number of M elements is smaller than N records however it still adds some time.
To print the result takes O(1) time.
That's why we can count the total complexity as O(N+M).
ANSWER: O(N+M)
